# behaviours-as-vectors-thesis-code
It's like word2vec for but for behaviours. I'm trying to see if we can have vectors for "behaviours". I'm using OpenDota API to obtain player replays and see if those can be modelled as a vector.

Here are the repositories you can use to generate vectors described in the paper/thesis:

node2vec - https://github.com/aditya-grover/node2vec
TGN - https://github.com/jinayshah7/tgn
LINE - https://github.com/jinayshah7/LINE
